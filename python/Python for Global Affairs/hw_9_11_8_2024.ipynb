      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Thank you for taking time on \n",
      "your holiday.  The purpose of this meeting is to update the Committee on financial developments \n",
      "over the weekend and to consider whether we want to take a policy action today.  I would like to \n",
      "start with a brief update on the markets from Bill Dudley and take any questions for him, and \n",
      "then I will introduce the issue, make a recommendation, and ask for your comments following \n",
      "that.  Bill, would you like to give us a short review? \n",
      " \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our videoconference on \n",
      "January 9, the market functioning in terms of the bank term funding markets has \n",
      "generally continued to improve, with the one-month and three-month LIBOR relative \n",
      "to the overnight index swap rates coming back very sharply.  They are now as narrow \n",
      "as they’ve been since the market turmoil began.  But elsewhere in terms of market \n",
      "functioning, we started to see a step backward last week—e specially late in the \n",
      "week—when we viewed the asset -backed commercial paper market beginning to \n",
      "deteriorate again, and there was some flight to quality into the Treasury bill market \n",
      "late last week. \n",
      " \n",
      " More important, the macro outlook and broader financial market conditions \n",
      "have continued to deteriorate quite sharply.  The S&P 500 index, for example, fell \n",
      "5.4 percent last week; it is down almost 10 percent so far this year.  Today it fell \n",
      "another 60 points, or 4.5 percent, so that means that the cumulative decline in the \n",
      "S&P 500, if it opens near where the futures markets closed today, will be nearly \n",
      "15 percent since the start of the year.  Global stock markets were also down very \n",
      "sharply today—Mo nday.  Depending on where you look, the range of decline was \n",
      "anywhere from 3 percent to 7½ percent, pretty much across the board.  Corporate \n",
      "credit spreads and credit default spreads have continued to widen, and bank mark-to-\n",
      "market losses and loan-loss provisions keep increasing.  The Merrill Lynch and \n",
      "Citigroup earnings announcements last week generally suggested a widening in terms \n",
      "of the scope of losses, not just in subprime but also in terms of credit card receivables \n",
      "and other loans. \n",
      " \n",
      "  A newish wrinkle here in terms of bank markdowns reflects the deterioration of \n",
      "some of the monoline guarantors.  Merrill Lynch, for example, announced a \n",
      "multibillion dollar charge for its exposure to ACA, which is the most impaired of the \n",
      "monoline guarantors.  The other monoline guarantors are in better shape, but they’ve \n",
      "either been downgraded, such as the case of Ambac by Fitch on Friday afternoon, or \n",
      "are under review for being downgraded by a number of different credit-rating \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "3 of 32agencies.  The problem with the monoline guarantors is that raising capital has \n",
      "become much more difficult.  Ten days ago, for example, MBIA issued 14 percent \n",
      "surplus notes, which are now trading at about 70 cents on the dollar.  It’s not clear \n",
      "how much additional capital is needed to keep the AAA rating.  The goal posts keep \n",
      "moving.  S&P, for example, raised its loss estimates on subprime mortgages about a \n",
      "week and a half ago, and this has implications for the monoline insurers in terms of \n",
      "their capital adequacy.   \n",
      " \n",
      "So the bottom line is that, unless the monoline insurers raise significant additional \n",
      "capital soon, further rating downgrades seem very, very likely.  This has three \n",
      "potential consequences that are noteworthy.  First, in the money market space, a \n",
      "number of money market products are wrapped by the monoline guarantors, including \n",
      "variable-rate demand notes, auction-rate securities, and tender option bonds.  Some of \n",
      "these securities have liquidity support, so if the securities can’t be rolled over, they’ll \n",
      "go to the banks, and this will increase the pressure on bank balance sheets.  For those \n",
      "without liquidity support, either they will be converted to longer-dated securities, \n",
      "which the investors will be surprised to find out they are holding, or the dealers will \n",
      "have to take them back on their books to prevent the auctions from failing.  A second \n",
      "consequence from monoline guarantor downgrades would be to the municipal bond \n",
      "funds.  The loss of AAA insurance raises the question of what the retail bond \n",
      "investors do.  Do they start pulling out their money and run?  So far things are pretty \n",
      "calm on that front.  For example, last week the net asset values of some of the major \n",
      "muni bond insurance funds actually increased a bit for the week.  So there are no \n",
      "signs of a run there yet, but we haven’t really explored this fully, given the fact that \n",
      "only one major monoline guarantor has been downgraded and that happened late, late \n",
      "last week.  Third, financial institutions have to mark down the value of the \n",
      "guarantors’ insurance as their financial conditions worsen.  In contrast, the monolines \n",
      "don’t have to mark to market.  Downgrading the monolines frontloads the hit to \n",
      "capital and potentially aggravates the magnitude of the hit to capital because market \n",
      "valuations can overshoot.  So it is not trivial to transfer this risk from the monolines \n",
      "to the financial institutions given the distinction that the monolines do not have to \n",
      "mark to market but financial institutions that use their insurance do. \n",
      " \n",
      "At this point, monetary policy expectations have priced in a lot of easing over the \n",
      "near term.  As of Friday’s close, there were about 67 basis points priced in through \n",
      "the January meeting at the end of the month and about 110 basis points priced in \n",
      "through the March meeting (if you look at the April federal funds futures contract).  \n",
      "There is likely more than that now given the decline in the equity futures market that \n",
      "we saw today.  So the markets are expecting quite a bit from the Fed.  I’ll be happy to \n",
      "take any questions, of course. \n",
      " \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there questions for Bill?  President Lacker? \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  Can you explain that third consequence of monoline downgrades?  I \n",
      "didn’t quite get that. \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "4 of 32MR. DUDLEY.  The monoline insurers don’t have to mark to market the consequences \n",
      "of the deterioration in, say, the structured-finance product they insured.  All they have to do is \n",
      "pay out, as it is incurred, the interest that the structured-finance product can’t pay out.  So their \n",
      "losses are going to be realized only very gradually over a long period of time.  There is no sort of \n",
      "foreshortening of all that into the present.  In contrast, if a monoline guarantor gets downgraded \n",
      "and so the financial institution no longer has the support of that monoline guarantee, they have to \n",
      "write down instantaneously the value of the assets that were wrapped by that guarantee.  So it’s \n",
      "quite a big difference in terms of the market impact as you transfer that risk from the monoline \n",
      "guarantors to the financial institutions that bought that insurance. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill?  President Hoenig. \n",
      "MR. HOENIG.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I don’t want to get ahead of what you might be \n",
      "saying, but if Bill could give us a sense of what the markets are doing overseas, I would \n",
      "appreciate just his sense of things. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, the market on Monday morning in Asia was down somewhere \n",
      "around 3, 4, or 5 percent, and it was everywhere, including some of the emerging markets that up \n",
      "to now had performed pretty well.  India took one of its biggest one-day hits, for example, in a \n",
      "very long time.  Then, we got to Europe, and the declines in Europe were actually a little bigger \n",
      "than the declines that we saw in Asia.  For example, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 Index, which is \n",
      "an index of 50 large European companies, was down 7¼ percent on Monday.  The market went \n",
      "down sharply at the open, it rallied back up a bit during the day, and then it came sharply down \n",
      "again at the close.  So for both indexes you are basically at or very close to the low for the day.  \n",
      "Bond markets reacted as you might expect.  Bond markets rallied as people became more \n",
      "pessimistic about the stock market.  In the currency market, we saw the sort of normal risk-\n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "5 of 32aversion behavior.  The euro underperformed, the dollar was in the middle, and the yen \n",
      "appreciated as people were reducing their risk appetites.   \n",
      "I talked to some people about what was going on in Europe.  I didn’t really feel as though \n",
      "my contacts there were focused exclusively on the financial guarantors.  That was part of the \n",
      "story, but there were other parts of the story, including the idea that maybe decoupling isn’t \n",
      "going to happen to the degree that we hoped.  Also, part of the story was that the risks of \n",
      "recession in the United States were increasing.  So financial guarantors got part of the blame for \n",
      "the stock market decline in Asia and Europe, but that by no means was the whole story. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  If not, let me just talk about the issue \n",
      "here.  I was reluctant to call this meeting, both because of the holiday and because the \n",
      "Committee did express a preference on January 9 for not moving between regularly scheduled \n",
      "meetings and I accepted that judgment on January 9.  However, I think there are times when \n",
      "events are just moving too fast for us to wait for the regular meeting.  I know it is only a week \n",
      "away, but seven trading days is a long time in financial markets.  As Bill described, over the \n",
      "holiday, global stock markets have been falling very sharply, both in Asia and in Europe.  As he \n",
      "mentioned, even though the U.S. markets are closed, the S&P 500 was off about 60 points today, \n",
      "close to 5 percent.  That makes the cumulative decline in the S&P 500 since our last FOMC \n",
      "meeting 16½ percent.  Obviously, it is not our job to target stock values or to protect stock \n",
      "investors, but I think that this is a symptom of both sharply mounting concerns about the \n",
      "economy and increasing problems in credit markets. \n",
      "On the economy, the data and the information that we can glean from financial markets \n",
      "reflect a growing belief that the United States is in for a deep and protracted recession.  \n",
      "Moreover, as we saw from the global markets today, the concern is rising that that recession will \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "6 of 32have global consequences.  Consequently, we saw, for example, an 8 percent drop today in the \n",
      "German stock market.  The dollar rose today, reflecting I think increasing belief that other \n",
      "central banks will have to follow us in cutting rates, and oil prices are down to about $87, \n",
      "reflecting expectations of slowing global demand.  So it is not necessarily a U.S.-only story. \n",
      "On the financial side, as Bill noted, a lot of things are going on.  The latest is the likely \n",
      "downgrade of one or more of the monoline insurers, which would cause banks and other \n",
      "financial institutions to have to mark down billions more of their holdings.  I think there is a \n",
      "general sense— I certainly feel in talking to market participants—that it is not just subprime \n",
      "anymore and that there are real concerns about other kinds of consumer credit—c redit cards, \n",
      "autos, and home equity loans—and that there is fear of housing prices falling enough that \n",
      "contagion will infect prime mortgage loans.  There is building in the market a real dynamic of \n",
      "withdrawal from risk, withdrawal from normal credit extension, which I think is very worrisome. \n",
      "Would a rate action today, before the start of trading tomorrow, be of help?  I don’t \n",
      "know.  In some sense it was a lucky break that today was a holiday because in the middle of the \n",
      "day we got a very good read on what the markets are doing tomorrow, and so we can get ahead \n",
      "of things as opposed to being forced, after a couple of disastrous days, to respond.  Again, I don’t \n",
      "know if this would help, but I think that indicating that the Fed is on top of the situation and that \n",
      "we are proposing to address economic and credit risks aggressively would help.  In any case, it \n",
      "would at least make clear that the Fed was in touch with the situation. \n",
      "I think we have to take a meaningful action—s omething that will have an important \n",
      "effect.  Therefore, I am proposing a cut of 75 basis points.  I recognize that this is a very large \n",
      "change.  I would not do that if I thought that the size of the cut was inconsistent with our \n",
      "medium-term macroeconomic objectives.  Let me discuss that a few minutes. \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "7 of 32As I said to some of you, on Friday I had a briefing from Dave Stockton and his team \n",
      "about their Greenbook forecast for next week’s meeting.  They have not made an explicit \n",
      "recession call, but they do forecast very weak growth going forward.  More important, in order to \n",
      "get that positive economic growth, they revised down their assumed path of the federal funds rate \n",
      "by 100 basis points—50 basis points next week and 50 basis points in March.  That gives a \n",
      "cumulative decline in the staff’s fed funds assumption of 200 basis points since August, which is \n",
      "consistent both with the markets and with a 225 basis point decline in medium-term r*, which is \n",
      "an indicator of the neutral rate, as well as the optimal policy rate that they calculate.  Importantly, \n",

      "next week more about a simulation the staff is working on, which shows that a severe recession \n",

      "accommodation as the situation calms down.  I think there is a case for doing that, given the fact \n",

      "Now, of course, there is also the issue of inflation.  Many of you have valid concerns \n",
      "about inflation.  Let me just make a few comments on that.  First, in the Greenbook, despite a \n",

      "optimistic in that it avoids an outright recession, the preliminary Greenbook forecast for 2009 \n",

      "into account any disinflationary effects that would arise if we did have an NBER recession or \n",
      "worse.  Again, I note that we have, for example, effects working through oil prices, which the \n",

      "Of course, the inflation numbers haven’t been all that I might have hoped for, and even \n",

      "risks of the financial markets.  All those are relevant to what we do next week.  But the key issue \n",
      "for me is what we get by acting now rather than nine days from now.  I note that the stock market \n",
      "has declined, despite the fact that the market has built in the expectation of 50 basis points, with \n",
      "some probability of 75.  If we do today pretty much exactly what is expected of us nine days \n",

      "response to the stock market.  I understand the comments about the other strains in the financial \n",
      "markets.  Although the thing that we have most commonly pointed to, and it has occasioned the \n",
      "most market discussion, has to do with the behavior of the LIBOR rate, LIBOR seems to have \n",

      "LIBOR.  So it seems to me that that situation has largely returned to normal. \n",

      "with perhaps more-adverse consequences for future incentives and for the economy as a whole.  I \n",
      "think that that is a risk we have to worry about.  It is very hard to judge what the probability of \n",
      "that risk is.  None of us can know for sure what the next nine days would be like if we did not \n",
      "act.  None of us can know the probability that the market will work through this stuff on its own.  \n",
      "It is a matter of judgment, and I think your judgment on this is right.  I strongly support it.  I just \n",

      "MR. HOENIG.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I am troubled by this, I will admit.  I understand the \n",

      "backing away from this in the future because part of the reason we have the problem today, of \n",
      "course, is the last crisis.  The desire is to intervene, to get the market rates down, and to bring \n",
      "confidence; but then our ability to pull out of that is compromised because we can’t be sure in an \n",

      "another move down the way.  It will be hard to stay at rates that are not going to at least invite \n",

      "doing this in combination with the TAF.  The TAF actually appears to have done its work pretty \n",
      "well, and the need for the TAF may be diminishing.  Not much more data will come in the next \n",
      "few days, if I have my schedule correct.  I think we are at a kind of juncture now where the \n",
      "spillover from the financial markets is not really much debatable; it is very clearly happening, \n",

      "16 of 32MR. FISHER.  There are some pros to moving now, and there are some cons.  Clearly, \n",
      "one of the pros is that we would have the element of surprise.  It is a holiday.  We have the \n",
      "benefit of some knowledge of new data and what has happened in the market starting in Asia and \n",
      "rolling through Europe, which Bill walked us through.  I do have some concerns, however, Mr. \n",

      "we discussed these a bit.  I have basically the same concerns that President Poole, President \n",
      "Hoenig, and President Lacker have.  The question is, What do we get for this?  What \n",
      "expectations do we build in for future decisionmaking?  My biggest concern, however, is that I \n",
      "have yet to see convincing evidence that we are seeing movement on the inflation front.  If we \n",
      "were to cut rates to this level today, as of now, in terms of the headline CPI and PCE numbers, \n",
      "we would have a negative real rate of interest, and I don’t understand quite fully what the \n",

      "costs; and given the risk of waiting, I think we should get to that right away.  I agree that it is not \n",

      "alleviated.  I think, President Hoenig, if we keep our eye on the inflation forecast, if we make \n",

      "during the discussions on this call, we have described these financial markets as fragile.  That \n",
      "strikes me as rather euphemistic for what we have been witnessing really since the first of this \n",
      "year, particularly what is being witnessed overseas today.  The losses appear to be self-\n",
      "reinforcing.  Panic appears to be begetting further pullbacks by investors, retail and institutional \n",
      "alike.  There seems to be continued interest in the safest currencies, and this pullback strikes me \n",
      "as quite nondiscriminate, geographically and in terms of sectors, companies, and even entire \n",
      "asset classes.  Certainly, we shouldn’t be responding to those moves unless, when we think about \n",
      "our credibility, we think about it both with respect to our inflation-fighting credibility and, I \n",
      "think as Governor Kohn just said, our financial stability credibility.  I think the standard for \n",
      "moving between meetings is a very high one; but looking at the evidence, both in the financial \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "23 of 32markets and in the real economy, and thinking about our own credibility, my sense is that we \n",
      "rather convincingly meet that standard. \n",
      "My judgment would be, if we chose not to act today, that we would in all likelihood not \n",
      "make it until next week.  There can’t be a ton of conviction that by virtue of 75 basis points \n",
      "today we are going to redress some of this fear and some of the psychology that is working \n",
      "against us in the markets.  But just because we don’t have a panacea, just because monetary \n",
      "policy can’t solve the monoline problem and can’t solve some of the other problems, doesn’t \n",
      "mean that we shouldn’t be doing our part.  It strikes me that by taking action today we are doing \n",
      "our part.  We are showing the financial markets and the real businesses that we do get it.  \n",
      "Speaking for myself, I am glad that the interbank funding markets are working better.  That puts \n",
      "them in a better position to take more advantage of changes in monetary policy.  Through the \n",
      "TAF and through time they are now lending to each other.  But based on what has happened in \n",
      "the last several days, it doesn’t look as though they are going to be lending to many others.  So \n",
      "our action today needs to be focused very much on that front. \n",
      "With all that said, Mr. Chairman—and recognizing how quickly the decoupling \n",
      "hypothesis seems to have raced away from these markets as quickly as it found its way into their \n",

      "MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I think it is very clear that the \n",

      "suggests that there are still some challenges there, both in headline and in core.  At the last \n",
      "meeting, a lot of us focused a lot on the potential for a regime switch.  We haven’t really talked \n",
      "about that much here, but I think this evidence suggests that there is much higher probability of a \n",
      "fairly rapid shift from a growth state to a recession state.  That is being reflected in the financial \n",

      "I think Bill would also say that the credit default swap spreads on a number of the \n",
      "financial institutions have been going up, even as some of the liquidity issues have been coming \n",
      "down.  There are very strong concerns about significant losses coming down the line—concerns \n",
      "not only about the monolines but also, as the Chairman said, about losses just because of the \n",
      "problems in the consumer sector—increasing delinquencies in a variety of areas, not just in \n",

      "put us in an even more negative position, when we are projecting the economy to be slowing and \n",
      "when, in fact, total inflation is above—c urrently at least, year over year—4 percent.  I understand \n",
      "the concerns about the markets and people’s uncertainty.  But we are taking these very dramatic \n",
      "actions right now, more perhaps than what we need when you say “where interest rates need to \n",
      "be.”  If we were to go 50 basis points now and 50 basis points at the next meeting, we are still \n",
      "moving down, but we are taking it in a more measured form.  I am not convinced that isn’t a \n",
      "better way of going, given where we are with the economy and given where we are with our \n",

    "The global financial crisis (GFC) refers to the period of extreme stress in global financial markets and banking systems between mid 2007 and early 2009. During the GFC, a downturn in the US housing market was a catalyst for a financial crisis that spread from the United States to the rest of the world through linkages in the global financial system. Many banks around the world incurred large losses and relied on government support to avoid bankruptcy. Millions of people lost their jobs as the major advanced economies experienced their deepest recessions since the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n",
